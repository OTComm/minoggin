 								<p class="p">Personal pronouns replace<a href="site_files/html/grammar/parts_of_speech/proper_nouns.html"> Proper Nouns</a> or<a href="site_files/html/grammar/parts_of_speech/common_nouns.html"> Common Nouns</a> that were previously mentioned. The form of a personal pronoun changes depending on the [[Grammatical Person]] and [[Case]].
								Replacement Function: Personal pronouns (like "he," "she," "it," "they") are used to replace nouns that have already been mentioned in a conversation or text. These can be proper nouns (specific names like "John" or "Mary") or common nouns (general names like "teacher" or "apple"). 
								Changes in Form: The form of personal pronouns changes based on:
								Grammatical Person: First person (I, we), second person (you), and third person (he, she, it, they).
								Position and Cases: Subjective case (used as the subject of a sentence, e.g., "He runs fast."). Objective case (used as the object of a sentence, e.g., "I saw her yesterday."). Possessive case (shows ownership, e.g., "Their car is new."). They and Them: When the identity of a person is unknown, they and them are used in place of he or she. Notice that "itâ€œ could also be used but that we do not refer to people as "it." </p>
