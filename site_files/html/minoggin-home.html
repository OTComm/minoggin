		<div class="centered-div welcome-mssg"><p>Welcome to the GitHub repository for <strong>Minoggin</strong>, a work-in-progress I began in July 2024.</p>
				At the moment, this repository serves as both a place to manage version control and a sneak peek at my evolving website. You'll find educational content already available, with much more to come as I continue building. Since it's a work in progress, expect to see some unfinished parts and rough edges while I develop the final version for the full launch.<br>
				
				<p><strong>Q: What does "Minoggin" mean?</strong></p>
				<p><strong>A:</strong> <em>Minoggin</em> is a word I created for this project. It combines the Swedish word "min," meaning "my," with "noggin," a playful term for "head." So, <em>Minoggin</em> means "my head" â€” a place for me to share the ideas and information in my head with you.</p>
